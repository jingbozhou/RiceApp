# Rice Variety Phenotype Query System

## 1. Overview

The **Rice Variety Phenotype Query System** is a lightweight, Windows-based desktop application designed for **interactive querying and comparison of rice phenotypic traits**.
The software is developed using **Python** and distributed as a **standalone Windows executable (EXE)** together with its underlying phenotype dataset.

The system enables users to:

* Browse a large collection of rice varieties
* Select multiple varieties for comparison
* View **basic information** and **quantitative phenotypic traits** side by side
* Interactively explore large tables using scrollable and resizable windows

This tool is particularly suitable for **rice breeding, variety evaluation, and phenotypic data exploration**.
